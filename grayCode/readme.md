### Approach 1: Backtrack, grayCodeBacktrack()
The idea is straightforward, we use recursion to try all possible ways of modifying 1 bit of the previous digit in the list and append the valid digit to result list

Actual running time:\

### Approach 2: Bit Manipulation, grayCodeBit()
Since each new digit is only depend on the previous digit, we can use iteration to add new digit iteratively, each new digit is generated by the bit manipulation `i^(i>>1)` where is the ith number

Time complexity is O(2^n) because there are a total of 2^n digits in the list:
