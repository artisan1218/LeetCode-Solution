### Approach 1:

The key part is how to deal with `consecutively` requirement. By defination, consecutive number is just numbers with consecutive ids, so we can start with enforcing ids. We can select from three `Logs` and make sure their ids are consecutive and nums are the same.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(l1.num) AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs AS l1, Logs AS l2, Logs AS l3
WHERE l1.id = l2.id - 1 AND l2.id = l3.id - 1 AND l1.num = l2.num AND l2.num = l3.num;
```
